**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I think I had a very shallow understanding of the workflow, so as long as I followed the workflow from beginning to end, I was ok. However, if I happened to stray from it, I was never sure what to do. Also, I had trouble figuring out which branch I need to be in.   

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?** 
By going through the git workflow and having to discuss and explain the purpose and function of each steps, I started to make the connections I was missing: understanding why the steps made sense where they appear. It was especially helpful to see my partner, who definately seemed to have a deeper understanding of git, navigate and jump around the steps of the workflow. Watching him helped to spurn me to make connections. He also taught me how to resolve merge conflicts, which I had not encountered before. 

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
Unfortunately, I didn't put much effort into asking questions, though I wish I had. Partly, I think it was due to feeling nervous and timid about the experience. Fortunately, my partner was responsive and the guide took the initiative and asked questions and offered explanations for unfamiliar concepts.

**What still confuses you about git?**
It feels like the process is starting to become clearer. Whereas before the git workflow looked blurry, now it's starting to come into focus. For now, I don't have any issues that confuse me. However, when I'm able to see with more clarity, I may find some issues then.  

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
Overall, it was a good experience and I learned a lot. It helped to clear up and solidify my understanding of the git workflow, and I was able to picked up new information. I think my partner and I worked well together, and our guide was very helpful and encouraging. She provided a good level of support, without imposing in any way during the session.
