## Git Workflow and Branching GPS Reflection

- What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
- What still confuses you about git?
- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

This was my first experience in a guided pairing session with a guide and another member of my cohort. I believe the session was great overall. Communication was clear between my teammate and our guide did a great job of explaining git concepts. Our pair and I were both focused and spent some time building rapport. Our guide did a great job in pointing us in the right direction if there was a concept we were struggling with. 

Before the GPS session, I was still struggling with the differences between pull, fetch, and merge. Our guide clarified the differences between those three. Essentially, a pull is a combination of fetch and merge. In addition, I have a better understanding of pulling through GitHub. We were told that we shouldn't mregre the master branch with our feature branch through git, but instead do it through GitHub. 

I asked our guide what is the role of the driver and the navigator, and how we should proceed in Google Hangouts. I also asked our guide and my pair if I were using the correct commands, and they clarified if it were incorrect and correct. 

The only thing that still confuses me about git is merge conflicts. I understand the concept behind merge conflicts, but we ran into an error on GitHub when we thought we resolved the conflict. When we checked the git status in our local repository, there didn't seem to be any conflicts. I'm not sure what we did wrong, but we couldn't discover the root of the problem.
